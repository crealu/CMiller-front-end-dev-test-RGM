Front End Developer Test

# Technologies Used
Bootstrap was a large portion of what I used alongside html, css, and js. Most
of the positioning of elements in the html was styled using bootstrap's grid
system. Bootstrap has a useful carousel that works well for cycling through
images. It allows users to select specific slides with the circular
indicators.

Node and npm were run on the command line throughout the project to help check
for errors as I compiled and tested code.

To achieve some of the specified picture styles I used Adobe Illustrator and
Photoshop.


# Struggles Faced
The scroll animation effect for the checkerboard section and percent numbers
was what I struggled with the most. The toughest was getting the animation to
trigger at the desired y-point of the body.

I struggled to find a solution to fitting the images into the bootstrap
carousel for a while before I came up with an alternate approach.


# What I enjoyed the most
Getting the scroll effect to work. This is something I have been meaning to
learn and I am glad I was able to come up with a few different ways to
accomplish it.

Styling to get the just-right fit was something I really enjoyed too. To be
able to recreate the wireframe with code was rewarding. Having the ability to
fine tune the small details makes it that much more fun!
